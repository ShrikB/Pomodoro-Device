# Pomodoro Device ⏱️🍅  
*A hardware-based Pomodoro timer with LCD, keypad, buzzer, and LED alerts.*

This project implements a **Pomodoro timer** on an Arduino Nano using a **16x2 LCD**, **4x4 keypad**, **two push buttons**, a **buzzer**, and an **LED**.  
It allows you to input a custom countdown duration via the keypad, start/stop with a button, and alerts you with sound and light when time is up

## ✨ Features

- **Custom Timer Input** – Enter minutes and seconds (MMSS format) through a 4x4 keypad.  
- **Weight Button Safety** – The countdown only works while the weight button is held down; lifting it early triggers an alarm.  
- **Start/Stop Button** – Separate button to begin or cancel the countdown.  
- **LCD Display** – Shows prompts, entered time, and live countdown.  
- **Alerts** –  
  - Beep and blink when the timer finishes.  
  - Repeated alerts if the weight button is lifted prematurely.
